![View Card Details](public/images/press/view_card.png)

This is a simple project that will allow users of cards to check their current balance as well as previous charges. 

The idea is to make a Laravel web application that allows you to check your charging card details, balance and other information either through the web UI or through an API call.

Currently, the basic steps of web UI have been completed. 

Next on the list:

- [ ] Implement API
- [ ] Optimise database record fetching
- [x] Set up database
